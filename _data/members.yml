  blurb: "As a modern day magician, Ryan’s greatest talents lie in creating something out of nothing. Swooping behind a few screens, he waves his magic mouse, says abracadabra (in HTML) and voila! A seamlessly functioning website, database or gaming product is pulled out of his Toronto Maple Leafs hat. Ryan attended NAIT's DIMD program to refine his tricks into a successful career. Prior to joining FREE, he’s been an integral part of multiple digital teams including Chinook Multimedia. To unplug and recharge his battery he enjoys playing hockey, mountain biking, cooking and frequent visits to Booster Juice."
